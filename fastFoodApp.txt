Some of the features/requirements of the fast Food delivery app include: - 
1. User should be able to sign-in as a customer
2. Customer can make an order thatâ€™ll be delivered to his address
3. Geo-location and order tracking
4. Customers have 2 modes of payment: online, cash on delivery
5. Customer pays delivery charge different from the cost of the food, etc. The delivery charge is directly proportional to the
   distance from restaurant to the customers address.
6. Customer/driver can see his/her order history
7. Customer can chat with a company's representative from the app to resolve any issues
8. Customer can track the status of his order and the drivers location en route order delivery in real-time
9. Merchant can offer targeted discounts to a customer via a promo code
10. The merchants interface allows him to update the price and quantity of food remaining in real-time.
    Thus, a customer does not make an order thinking it will be delivered, when actually the food has finished, etc.
